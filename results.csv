The Salamanca neighborhood is one of the most relevant areas of Madrid both for its peculiar distribution and for the neighbors who have traditionally inhabited its emblematic streets. Its construction dates from the second half of the 19th century and corresponds to the urban expansion carried out during the reign of Isabel II. The precursor to whom it owes its name was the Malaga-born José de Salamanca y Mayol, Marquis of Salamanca, who conceived a new site with a careful construction that would house the aristocratic and bourgeois classes of Madrid. Of nineteenth-century style, it is characterized by its special regular distribution in the form of a checkerboard with perpendicular streets. Its buildings are of special interest thanks to their architectural quality and the beauty of their facades. Traditionally, Salamanca was a residential area, especially inhabited by the country's political and economic elites. In the last fifty years this residential character coexists with other activities such as business, diplomatic and especially commercial, as it is one of the most important luxury fashion areas of the capital. The Parque del Buen Retiro is the real protagonist of this neighborhood of Madrid that has its flanks in the Calles de Alcalá and O'Donnell in the north end, Doctor Esquerdo Street in the east, the Avenida del Mediterráneo and Paseo de Reina Cristina in the south and Alfonso XII Street in the west end.",,,"

The Salamanca neighborhood is one of the most relevant areas of Madrid both for its peculiar distribution and for the neighbors who have traditionally inhabited its emblematic streets. Its construction dates from the second half of the 19th century and corresponds to the urban expansion carried out during the reign of Isabel II. The precursor to whom it owes its name was the Malaga-born José de Salamanca y Mayol, Marquis of Salamanca, who conceived a new site with a careful construction that would house the aristocratic and bourgeois classes of Madrid. Of nineteenth-century style, it is characterized by its special regular distribution in the form of a checkerboard with perpendicular streets. Its buildings are of special interest thanks to their architectural quality and the beauty of their facades. Traditionally, Salamanca was a residential area, especially inhabited by the country's political and economic elites. In the last fifty years this residential character coexists with other activities such as business, diplomatic and especially commercial, as it is one of the most important luxury fashion areas of the capital. The Parque del Buen Retiro is the real protagonist of this neighborhood of Madrid that has its flanks in the Calles de Alcalá and O'Donnell in the north end, Doctor Esquerdo Street in the east, the Avenida del Mediterráneo and Paseo de Reina Cristina in the south and Alfonso XII Street in the west end.",,,"

Gradually, it became a strategic point in the city, being a gateway for traders who came to sell their products at the nearby markets of San Miguel and La Cebada.

There is truth in that statement, but it is also one of the most elegant. A walk along its streets is an opportunity to enjoy beautiful tree-line pavements, charming squares, such as Olavide, and emblematic buildings like the Hospital de Maudes, the Casa de la Flores or the mansions in the well-known ""Golden Triangle"": an area where much of Madrid's aristocracy settled in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and that extends from Paseo de la Castellana to the streets of Génova, Almagro and Miguel Ángel.,This is an open borough where sophisticated restaurants (Sergi Arola Gastro, La Caña or Atelier Belge) mix with popular taverns. This is a neighbourhood of art galleries (Astarté, Elvira González, Marlborough), exhibition centres, such as the one belonging to Canal de Isabel II (built inside a huge water tank), or museums, such as the Sorolla Museum or the former Chamberí Metro Station. We must not forget to mention the nightlife and clubs. Just to name a few establishments: the mythical Sala Clamores, the Moma Fifty Six or the classic Club Fortuny.",,,"
