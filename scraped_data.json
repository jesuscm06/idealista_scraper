The constructed area is 2,200 m2 according to cadastral information, 120 m2 of which correspond to the caretaker's house. The main house is distributed over 2 main floors. On the ground floor we find a large living-dining room of very large dimensions and with views of the covered porches that surround the house, a kitchen with an office area that is fully equipped, and a pantry, the service bedroom with a full bathroom and a beautiful suite, with dressing room, large bedroom and large bathroom. On the first floor we find a double room, with a built-in wardrobe with 8 doors, and a suite with a living room (or dressing room, as preferred), the master bedroom from which you can access a relaxing covered terrace with views of the entire property, and a huge bathroom complete with shower. In the semi-basement there is a large parking area (for 3 or 4 cars) and a living room with integrated kitchen, with bar and fireplace, which can also be accessed directly from the pool. On this same floor we find the bathrooms for the tennis players (one for ladies and one for gentlemen, with showers and very practical) and two large rooms for the guests who stay behind in those celebrations. It is an exclusive property that is not at all usual. It would probably be perfect even for companies in the hotel industry, since its proximity to the city and its own facilities make it very suitable.
